In each cluster, four traditional houses were selected having similar size and design, and with house owners agreeing to participate in the study. These sentinel houses were located close to permanent or semi-permanent Anopheles larval sites. Indoor and outdoor (household veranda) paired HLCs were performed by a two-member team (local volunteers with informed consent) per house, in four sentinel HLC houses in each cluster [4]. Host seeking mosquitoes landing on exposed feet and legs were caught using an aspirator for 50 min each hour from 1800 h to 0600h. Mosquitoes were held in individual paper cups labelled for each hour, location (indoor or outdoor) and house code. Female mosquito specimens were transported to an on-site study laboratory for further processing. In total, with 52 nights of HLCs in 12 clusters, and in 4 houses each (inside and outside) there were 4,992 person nights of HLC collections (2,496 indoors and outdoors each).

",Thailand,2014,"Jan 2014-Dec 2015. Mosquito collections were conducted once monthly from January 2014 to December 2015 (24 months).

",Indonesia,2021,"Double net traps (DNT) were used for all mosquito collections between 18:00 and 06:00 on designated collection nights [41]. Traps were set adjacent to structures with a hanging SE or placebo device. The trap consisted of one small tent inside a larger net, with a small gap underneath the larger net to allow mosquitoes to enter. Both tents were situated underneath a tarp roof to protect the structures from rain. Every hour, a second volunteer entered the larger net and collected trapped mosquitoes. These were counted by hour and preserved. Collectors rotated responsibilities hourly. Upon collection, mosquitoes were identified to genus and preserved in Eppendorf tubes with desiccant beads for future investigations.
 A total of 27,509 mosquitoes were collected across all households over 876 total nights of mosquito collections, including 240 nights of baseline collections and 636 nights during the follow-up period (Table 1, S1 Table). Mosquitoes were captured on 98.2% of all nights (n = 860), with a median of 21 mosquitoes per collection night when present. There was no significant difference in presence versus absence between baseline (97.5%, n = 234/240) and follow-up (98.4%, n = 626/636) collections (p = 0.63), but a significant decrease in overall mosquito abundance, independent of intervention status, was observed as the study progressed (Table S2; Weekly Risk ratio (RR): 0.96 [0.94–0.98], p < 0.001). Clusters were assigned following baseline collections and SE and placebo products were installed before follow-up collections began in the second week of January 2021.

Mosquito collections were conducted in all sentinel households weekly, with a small degree of missed coverage during early baseline collection weeks.

Human-landing catches of mosquitoes were done outdoors. Each collection site comprised two teams, each consisting of two persons: one volunteer served as bait and the other as collector. The first team captured the mosquitoes from 18:00 to 24.00 h and the other from midnight until dawn (06:00 h). The collector captured the mosquitoes upon landing on the human bait by using a plastic collection tube. All captured mosquitoes were kept individually in a 1.5 ml sterile microtube with cap, placed on ice and transferred to 4 °C refrigerator for subsequent morphological identification. All volunteers and field staff were monitored for malaria infection during the field work and thereafter on a weekly basis for 2 months. Mosquito collections were conducted from three locations in Waeng (A: 5° 48' 27″ N, 101° 50' 44″ E; B: 5° 49' 12″ N, 101° 51' 20″ N and C: 5° 50' 5″ N, 101° 51' 7″ E) and three sites in Sukhirin Districts (D: 5° 48' 4″ N, 101° 45' 2″ E; E: 5° 48' 8″ N, 101° 45' 13″ N and F: 5° 47' 40″ N, 101° 42' 51″ E) in Narathiwat Province during 2018 and 2019 (Fig. 1).

The collection sites had a tropical monsoon climate and were located near Hala-Bala tropical rain forest, covering an area of approximately 1.3 square kilometers across Yala and Narathiwat Provinces along Thailand-Malaysia border approximately between 5° 37'–6° 14' N and 101° 8' E–101° 51' E.

",Malaysia,2013-2014,"Human landing catches were performed by trained collectors working in pairs. Glass tubes were placed over mosquitoes as they alighted on a collector's exposed leg, and then the tube was sealed with cotton wool. Collections were carried out between 18:00 and 06:00 h each day. During each hour, mosquitoes were collected for 45 min, followed by a 15 min rest break for the collectors, and stored in bags labelled by hour. Members of the collection team rotated, so that only one exposed their leg during each hour, the other helping to catch the mosquitoes. Monkey-baited trap represented a whole night's catch. A comparative evaluation of human-baited (HENET) and macaque-baited (MENET) electrocuting nets against existing trapping methods for these hosts (HLC and MBT, respectively) was carried out between November 2013 and January 2014 in Tajau Laut, Kudat, Sabah. Experiments followed a randomised 4 × 4 Latin square design of traps × sites × nights and took place over 40 nights (10 replicates), sampling within replicates occurring on 4 consecutive nights. Sampling sites were between 100 and 150 m apart and collections were conducted between 18:00 h and 06:00 h. Paired HLC collectors and paired macaques were selected from a pool (8 men; 6 macaques) and rotated randomly throughout the experiment between HLC and HENET, and MBT and MENET, respectively.
